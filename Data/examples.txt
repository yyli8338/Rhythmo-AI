EXAMPLE 1
body_part: Ankle 
injury_type: Tendonitis 
mild_description: Your tendon is stretched more than normal, but it can still stabilize your foot and ankle. Mild tenderness and swelling. 
moderate_description: Tendon has a partial tear, and you have moderate tenderness and swelling. Moderate ankle instability. 
severe_description: Tendon has complete tear. Tendon is divided into 2 pieces. A complete tear usually requires surgery. 
subcategories: Peroneal tendonitis - pain and inflammation along the outer edge of the heel; Achilles tendonitis - casues heel and calf pain, especially when exercising; Exterior tendonitis - causes pain on the top of the foot, rare type of ankle tendonitis 
description: Tendonitis is a condition where the connective tissues between your muscles and bones inflame. 
mild_min_healing_duration: 14 days (2 weeks)
mild_max_healing_duration: 21 days (3 weeks)
moderate_min_healing_duration: 28 days (4 weeks)
moderate_max_healing_duration: 42 days (6 weeks)
severe_min_healing_duration: 84 days (3 months)
severe_max_healing_duration: 168 days (6 months)
self_recovery: No. Requires intentional rest and non-use of the tendon. 
symptoms: Pain in tendon; difficulty moving joint; crackling sensation when you move the tendon; swelling; stiff joints
immediate_remedies : Rest; ice; compression; elevation; medication; protection; crutches
when_to_see_doctor: Fever and chills --> possible infection; fever, swelling; illness; multiple sites of pain; inability to move affected area 
mild_min_pain_level: Mild tendonitis (stages 1-2) - Pain is caused by extreme exertion that ceases when activity stops. Patients can often exercise, work, or compete with mild tendonitis without severe repercussions. 
moderate_avg_pain_level: Moderate tendonitis (stages 3-4) - Pain is caused by extremebe exertion that lasts for several hours after physical activity has stopped. When pain severity is approaching stage 4, normal functioning is impaired. 
severe_max_pain_level: Severe tendonitis (stage 5-6) - Intense pain occurs during physical activity and long after the activity stops, sometimes lasting for days and not associated with any extreme exertions. Affect day to day function.
common_causes: Overuse or improper exercise techniques; manual labour; sports; structural abnormalities; traning surfaces that do not "give" to muscles
risk_factors: Gardneing, woodworking, shoveling, painting, scrubbing, sports, poor posture, weak muscles; age
treatment_types: \
treatment_side_effects: Pain at your injection site; soreness after physio; bleeding or an infection after surgery
physiotherapy_exercises: Calf stretch, towel stretch, ankle circles, toe raises
long_term_remedies : Rest; NSAIDs, Ccorticosteroid injections, braces, physical therapy, message, acupuncture
potential_chronic_injuries: Loss of ankle dorsiflexion - results in compromised walking and muscles higher in the leg and pelvis lose efficnecy and strength. Untreated tendonitis can get worse, leading to tendon tears. 
specific_body_part: Run along the outer ankle bone and side of the foot. These tough bands of tissue connect the muscles in the lower leg to the bones in the foot. 
complications: Increase the risk of tendon breaking down or tearing; chronic tendonitis (a constant, dull pain when you move); difficulty or inability to move the affected part of your body; torn tendons; muscle weakness 
diagnosis_methods: Physical exam by assing whether there are bursitis (inflammation) and testing - X ray, MRI 
how_common: Around 30% of all runners exhibit Achilles tendinopathy, with an annual incidence of 7% to 9%; 2 to 5% of the general population have tendonitis 
recovery_rate: Almost 99% cases recover completely without surgery. Almost 95% of cases recover after surgery. 
professional_help_frequency: About 30% of all healthcare visits for musculoskeletal conditions affect the tendon, including tendonitis 
home_treatment_expectation: PRICE method; avoid doing things that increase pain/swelling; take NSAIDs; coritcosteroid injections, physio 
doctor_recommendation: PRICE program; short course of aspirin, ibuprofen, or other anti-inflammatory drugs 
surgery_requirement: If ankle pain persists after 4-6 weeks; repair torn tendons or to relocate the tendon and repair "the tunnel" from which they have dislocated
lowering_risk: Stretch and warm up before activity; stop if feel pain; start slow; wear proper clothing and equipment
treatment_goals: Decrease inflammation by: rest, anti-inflammatory medication, icing the tendon intermittently, or use of cast
prevention_measures: Avoid staying in the same position - take breaks every 30 mins; learn proper posture; avoid sitting with leg folded under your bottom; don't use one hand to carry heavy objects
initial_and_delayed_symptoms: Initial - localized pain, swelling and stiffness. Pain is first sign. Delayed - pain typically lessens over time then resurfaces the longer you spend on the ankle. 

EXAMPLE 2
body_part: Shoulder
injury_type: Rotator Cuff 
mild_description: Fibres of the muscles or tendons are stretched beyond their capacity
moderate_description: Fibres of the muscles or tendons are strained too far and partially tear
severe_description: Fibres of the muscles or tendones completely tear
subcategories: Acute, caused by a particular incident; Deegnerative, caused by repetitive use over a long period. General wear and tear, tendinitis, bursitits, tendon strain/tear, shoulder impingement
description: Rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that hold the shoulder joint in place and allow you to move your arm and shoulder. Problems occur when part of the rotator cuff becomes damaged. 
mild_min_healing_duration: 14 days (2 weeks)
mild_max_healing_duration: 112 days (4 months)
moderate_min_healing_duration: 28 days (4 weeks)
moderate_max_healing_duration: 168 days (6 months)
severe_min_healing_duration: 168 days (6 months)
severe_max_healing_duration: 365 days (12 months)
self_recovery: Rotator cuff tears don't heal on their own without surgery, but many people can improve functionally and decrease pain with nonsurgical treatments by strengthening their shoulder muscles 
symptoms: Recurrent pain, espeically with certain activities; pain that prevents you from sleeping on your injured side; grating or cracking sounds when moving your arm; limited ability to move arm; muscle weakness
immediate_remedies : Stop doing what caused the pain and try to avoid painful movements; alternating between heat and ice therapy; NSAIDs, pain-relieving creams
when_to_see_doctor: Shoulder joint that appears to be deformed after a fall. No ability to use shoulder or move arm away from body. Intense pain. Sudden swelling 
mild_min_pain_level: Mild Grade 1 - General stretching of the tendon, not much loss of strength or function 
moderate_avg_pain_level: Moderate Grade 2 - Continuity of the tendon but it more like a frayed rope, or holes in a blanket. The shoulder will have significant weakness
severe_max_pain_level: Severe Grade 3 - Full rupture of the tendon 
common_causes: Athletic activiites that involve excessive, repetitive, overhead motion, such as swimmming, tennis, pitching, and weightlifting. Everyday houshold activities. 
risk_factors: Increase with age, occupation that require repetitive overhead arm motions e.g carpentry or house painting, certain sports, family history 
treatment_types: Arm sling to rest shoulder; NSAIDs; physical therapy for strengthening and stretching; steroid injections to ease pain and swelling
treatment_side_effects: Pain at rest/night/lying down; weakness and loss of motion; stiffness
physiotherapy_exercises: Doorway stretch; high to low rows; reverse flys; lawn mower pull; overhead lifts; beyond the neck pulldown; upright rows; bench dips
long_term_remedies : Rest; NSAIDs, strengthening, ultrasound therapy, corticosteroid injection, surgery for severe cases 
potential_chronic_injuries: Weakness, tenderness in the shoulder and pain when sleeping on affected arm. Shoulder can experience a loss of range of motion. With a large tear, there can be continous pain and muscle weakness
specific_body_part: Shoulder. When the tendon is torn away from the bone
complications: Permanent loss of motion or weakness of the shoulder joint
diagnosis_methods: Imaging tests. X-ray helps to rule out bone spurs as a cause of symptoms. MRI enables doctor to see the soft tissue in the shoulder to determine if rotator cuff tear and whether it is partial or full thickness
how_common: More than 2 million Americans experience some type of rotator cuff problem every year. Affects 2-4 million people in the US every year 
recovery_rate: Rotator cuff surgery success rate is more than 95% for minor tears; success rate is greater than 70% for two tendon tears
professional_help_frequency: Each year, almost 2 million people in the US visit their doctors because of rotator cuff tears. 
home_treatment_expectation: Pain from minor rotator cuff injury often diminishes on its own with proper care. But most rotator tears don't heal without surgery
doctor_recommendation: Rest, ice and physical therapy; surgery
surgery_requirement: Can stop or reverse early rotator cuff damage without surgery. Try using rest, ice and heat, NSAIDs and physio. If symptoms don't get better after 3-6 months, may need surgery
lowering_risk: Avoid repetitive overhead activities. Avoid lifting heavy objects with an oustretched arm. Ensure that the load is close to your body to reduce the strain on the shoulder
treatment_goals: Focuses on decreasing pain and swelling of the tendon, preserving or restoring normal range of motion, strenghening muscles important to shoulder function, and resotring normal shoulder mechanics. First goal is to preserve the ability to move the shoulder 
prevention_measures: Strengthen shoulders, work on flexibility, always warm up, practise moderation, improve ergonomics 
initial_and_delayed_symptoms: Initial - snapping sensation, immediate weakness Delayed - pain and arm weakness, pain in shoulder when lift arm 



EXAMPLE 3
body_part: Leg
injury_type: Hamstring Pull 
mild_description: Mild muscle strain or pull
moderate_description: Partial hamstring tears, more painful and tender
severe_description: Complete muscle tear
subcategories: Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3
description: Strain or tear to the tendons or large muscles at the back of the thigh
mild_min_healing_duration: 1 day
mild_max_healing_duration: 3 days
moderate_min_healing_duration: 7 days (1 week)
moderate_max_healing_duration: 28 days (4 weeks)
severe_min_healing_duration: 168 days (6 weeks)
severe_max_healing_duration: 224 days (8 weeks)
self_recovery: Most hamstring strains will heal on their own or with some physical therapy
symptoms: Sudden, sharp pain in the back of the thigh; snapping or popping feeling; tenderness; bruising 
immediate_remedies : RICE method; Rest - rest leg as much as possibe; Ice - apply cold packs to the hamstring for up to 20 mins every 2-3 hours during the day; wrap injured area with compression bandage to minimize swelling; elevate leg to the heart to reduce swelling
when_to_see_doctor: Mild hamstrings strains can be treated at home, but see a health care provider if you can't bear weight on the injured leg or if you can't walk more than 4 steps without a lot of pain
mild_min_pain_level: Mild Grade 1 - minor partial muscle tear
moderate_avg_pain_level: Moderate Grade 2 - Moderate partial muscle tear
severe_max_pain_level: Severe Grade 3 - Subtotal muscle tear/tendon
common_causes: Powerful movements e.g sprinting, lunging or jumping that overstretch the tendons/muscles; overuse or overstretch of tendons; imbalance size in leg muscles, poor technique, not warming up
risk_factors: Sports, age, muscle imbalance, tired muscles, earlier hamstring injury
treatment_types: PRICE Method and physio therapy. If muscle has pulled free from pelvis, surgeon can reattach it - severe muscle tears
treatment_side_effects: From surgery: nerve injury, tendon rupture and persistent pain with sitting
physiotherapy_exercises: Straight leg hamstring stretch, bent knee hamstring stretch, hamstring swings, upsidedown cycling, straight leg raise, standing hamstring curl, hamstring catches, isometric hamstrings
long_term_remedies : Hamstring stretches when pain starts to subside. Gentle exercises, walking and cycling and hamstring strengthening exercises
potential_chronic_injuries: Chronic hamstring tendinopathy
specific_body_part: Strain or tear to the tendons or large muscles at the back of the thigh
complications: Chronic hamstring pain and injury associated with too early return to play; reinjury related to areas of calcification and inflammation in hamstring after injury; hamstring syndrome - scar formation and impingement on the sciatic nerve
diagnosis_methods: Based on symptoms. Test tenderness and examine swelling and brusising around hamstring. Somestimes may ask for MRI test
how_common: Hamstring pulls are the most common non-contact injury representing 27% of all muscle traumas in professional sports 
recovery_rate: A hamstring injury takes an average 20 days to revoer from with a 30% chance of re-injury in the first two months
professional_help_frequency: Hamstring pulls occur very frequntly in athletes
home_treatment_expectation: Most treatments can be done at home
doctor_recommendation: Take a break to rest hamstring muscles that allow the damaged tissues to repair; avoid activities that cause pain, swelling or discomfort. If you have more than a minor muscle strain, your health care provider may recommend that you use crutches to keep your weight off the injured leg. Ice
surgery_requirement: Most hamstring injuries that involve partial tearing of the muscles heal over time with physio. If muscles pulled free from pelvis or shinbone, surgery is required. Only when tendon has been pulled completely away from the bond, should surgery be considered 
lowering_risk: Warm up before exercise, keep muscles strong and flexible, increase duration and intensity of exericses slowly, if feel pain - stop activity immediately
treatment_goals: Limit pain, inflammation and swelling
prevention_measures: Dyanmic stretching to prevent hamstring injury while also achieving higher performance; Nordic hamstring exercise protocol 5 times in addition to regular sports training
initial_and_delayed_symptoms: Initial - Sharp pain, popping sensation in the back of the leg; may not be able to keep running, fall Delayed - Swelling, ecchymosis, numbness, tingling and distal extremity weakness (static nerve irritation)
